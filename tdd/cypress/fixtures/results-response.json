  "original_text": "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, requiring unprecedented global cooperation and innovative solutions. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are the primary driver of rising global temperatures. The effects are already visible worldwide, from melting ice caps and rising sea levels to more frequent extreme weather events and shifts in agricultural patterns.",
